## About :pushpin:

I built this game just to practice Vanilla JS and CSS.
It was created a while ago and just went through it to refactor the code and things have changed a lot. Updated it to use `querySelector`, `let`, `const` and toggle class names to use CSS for the animations instead of using inline styles.

The computer has no easy or hard mode. It is always trying to win, although the logic needs improving.

## Future Features

There are a couple of features I want to add.

- Check the computer moves logic and improve. _2nd iteration_
- Randomise which players starts the game. Currently the computer always goes second.
- Add a scoring system
- Option for a second human player
- Make it into a react project
